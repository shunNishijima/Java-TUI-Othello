D1.2
Example: Coffee machine: No changes, as it is already an S-system.
• An automatic sudoku solver: No changes, as it is already an S-system.
• An interactive sudoku playing app.: make it automatic sudoku solver. 
• A student calendar app with scheduled lectures.: the program changed can only show lecture's schedule.
• The Tarp learning management system (p. 13).: the program changed only show the progress of online lecture.
• Untappd (a social network that tracks which beer you drank and shares it to your friends).: changed program can only count how much beer a user drank.
• Airbnb: changed program can only show information of house which a user has.
• A PDF reader.: it only can read the PDF.
• A compiler for a textual programming language like Java.: it works for only one version of Java. works perfectly everytime. it will not be updated.
• A compiler for a graphical modelling language like UML.: it works for only one version. works perfectly everytime. it will not be updated.
• An augmented reality set.: it shows one picture everytime and the picture is static.


D1.3
Example: Coffee machine: some account management system could be implemented such that the
machine keeps track of customer’s previous orders and can recommend new drinks based on this data

• An automatic sudoku solver.: same as below.
• An interactive sudoku playing app. : it has function which shows ranking of online multiplayer.
• A student calendar app with scheduled lectures.: users can put attendency in calendar and every user can see it.
• The Tarp learning management system (p. 13). : No changes, as it is already an E-system.
• Untappd (a social network that tracks which beer you drank and shares it to your friends).: No changes, as it is already an E-system.
• Airbnb: No changes, as it is already an E-system.
• A PDF reader.: we can share the links of the PDF and we can edit online.
• A compiler for a textual programming language like Java.: users can edit the function of compiler and edit answers of compiler when it worked incorrectly.
• A compiler for a graphical modelling language like UML.: same as above.
• An augmented reality set.: No changes, as it is already an E-system.

D1.4
Example:
Coffee machine -> Prescriptive model : recipe tells the machine how to make the drinks
Washing machine -> Descriptive model: manual teaches users how to operate the machine
*project -> Predictive model : effort estimation predict how much time will be needed to successfully design the system

A PDF reader. -> Prescriptive Model: the program of the reader tells the machine how the objective is seen.
A student calendar app with scheduled lectures. -> Descriptive Model : tha manual explain how to add events and how to use several views of calender.
Airbnb -> Predictive Model : This systems can recommend suggestion to the users accoding to user history.

• An automatic sudoku solver: No changes, as it is already an S-system.
As a user, I want to be able to see the start buttom, so I can start.
1.3
• Untappd (a social network that tracks which beer you drank and shares it to your friends).: No changes, as it is already an E-system.

Big organisation - “Have a test coverage of 99% and complete integration and unit testing before
deploying new version every Friday”
Small organisation - “Ensure unit testing is done on every new updated class that is pushed in the
repository”

• An interactive sudoku playing app.
